The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Passwd Horde
password changing application version H3 (3.1.1).

Passwd provides fairly complete support for changing passwords via Poppassd,
LDAP, Unix expect scripts, the Unix smbpasswd command for SMB/CIFS passwords,
Kolab, ADSI, Pine, Serv-U FTP, VMailMgr, vpopmail, and SQL passwords.

The major changes compared to Passwd version H3 (3.1) are:
    * SECURITY: Fix XSS when specifying an invalid backend key
      (security@davidwharton.us, #8398).
    * A new SOAP driver.
