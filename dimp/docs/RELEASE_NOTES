The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Dynamic
Internet Messaging Program (DIMP) version H3 (1.1.1).

DIMP (Dynamic Internet Messaging Program, or Dynamic IMP) is a PHP-based
webmail system and a component of the Horde project.  DIMP is a version of the
webmail client IMP utilizing AJAX-like technologies to allow a more dynamic
user experience than traditionally offered via IMP.

DIMP requires at least Horde version 3.2 and IMP version H3 (4.2) to run.
Although not required to upgrade either Horde or IMP, it is STRONGLY
RECOMMENDED you do as any bugfixes to core functionality will occur in
these applications.

DIMP version H3 (1.1.1) is a minot upgrade in the 1.x release series,
including these enhancements:
    * Shift-Delete on multiple messages will move selection to next message.
    * Fix occasional buggy behavior when drag/drop folders.
    * The UP key will start at the bottom of the mailbox, if no current
      message is selected.
    * Add 'undelete' to Other Actions menu.
    * Correctly display quota on startup.
    * Fix some portal display issues.
    * Correctly show 'To' header when doing searches in sentmail and drafts
      mailboxes.
    * Various other bugfixes and performance/stability improvements.
