The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Dynamic
Internet Messaging Program (DIMP) version H3 (1.1.2).

DIMP (Dynamic Internet Messaging Program, or Dynamic IMP) is a PHP-based
webmail system and a component of the Horde project.  DIMP is a version of the
webmail client IMP utilizing AJAX-like technologies to allow a more dynamic
user experience than traditionally offered via IMP.

DIMP requires at least Horde version 3.2 and IMP version H3 (4.2) to run.
Although not required to upgrade either Horde or IMP, it is STRONGLY
RECOMMENDED you do as any bugfixes to core functionality will occur in
these applications.

DIMP version H3 (1.1.2) is a minor upgrade in the 1.x release series,
including these enhancements:
    * Allow dimp to work with IE 8 (uses IE 7 compatibility mode). Requires
      IMP 4.3.4+.
    * Add confirmation box if attempting to send message without subject.
    * Fix address autocomplete display on IE.
    * Other bugfixes and performance/stability improvements.
