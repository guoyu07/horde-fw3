The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Horde
Application Framework version 3.3.5.

This is a major security release that fixes a vulnerability in the form
library that allows overwriting of arbitrary local files with the permissions
of the web server user. It also fixes two XSS vulnerabilities in the
preference system and the MIME viewer library. The local file vulnerability
can only be exploited when running an application that uses image form fields,
like Turba H3 (2.3) or Ansel, and only by users who have write permissions to
those applications. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this release.

Thanks to Stefan Esser from SektionEins for finding the local file issue in a
code audit, and Martin Geisler and David Wharton for finding the XSS issues.

The Horde Application Framework is a modular, general-purpose web application
framework written in PHP.  It provides an extensive array of classes that are
targeted at the common problems and tasks involved in developing modern web
applications.

The major changes compared to Horde version 3.3.4 are:
    * Fixed vulnerability in image form fields that allows overwriting of
      arbitrary local files.
    * Fixed validation of "number" type preferences.
    * Fixed displaying unknown text MIME parts inline.
    * Many synchronization improvements.
    * Improved signup support.
    * Releasing memcache lock no longer takes 1 second.
    * Fixes when resetting passwords.
    * Export current locale to the environment.
    * Multiple other small bug fixes and improvements.

This is a security release that fixes a vulnerability that allows overwriting of local files, and two XSS vulnerabilities.
Synchronization and signup support have been improved. An issue with memcache locking taking a full second to release has been fixed. Various fixes when resetting a password have been applied, and the current locale is exported to the environment now.
