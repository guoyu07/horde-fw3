The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Horde
Application Framework version 3.3.3.

This is a minor security release that fixes unescaped output in the tag cloud
search script, and validates the Horde_Image driver name to prevent a possible
local file inclusion vulnerability. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this
release. Thanks to Gunnar Wrobel for finding these issues in a code audit.

The Horde Application Framework is a modular, general-purpose web application
framework written in PHP.  It provides an extensive array of classes that are
targeted at the common problems and tasks involved in developing modern web
applications.

The major changes compared to Horde version 3.3.2 are:
    * SECURITY: Fix unescaped output in the tag cloud block
    * SECURITY: Fix unvalidated Horde_Image driver name
    * Restore backwards compatibility with older Kronolith and Whups
      releases
    * Fix problems with SQL Shares and PostgreSQL
    * Support Mozilla Sunbird snooze properties
