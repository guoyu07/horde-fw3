The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Horde
Application Framework version 3.3.5.

The Horde Application Framework is a modular, general-purpose web application
framework written in PHP.  It provides an extensive array of classes that are
targeted at the common problems and tasks involved in developing modern web
applications.

This is a minor security release that fixes validation of "number" type
preferences, and prevents display of unknown text parts inline without
escaping the data.  All users are encouraged to upgrade to this release.

The major changes compared to Horde version 3.3.4 are:
    * SECURITY: Fix validation of "number" type preferences.
    * SECURITY: Don't display unknown text parts inline.
    * Releasing memcache lock no longer takes 1 second.
    * Fixes when resetting passwords.
    * Export current locale to the environment.
    * Multiple other small bug fixes and improvements.
