The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Horde
Application Framework version 3.3.6.

This is a bugfix release that also fixes an XSS vulnerability in the
administration interface and improves the XSS filter to work around an XSS
vulnerability in Firefox browsers.

Thanks to Juan Galiana Lara and Daniel FernÃ¡ndez Bleda from Internet Security
Auditors for finding the XSS vulnerability in the administration interface.

The Horde Application Framework is a modular, general-purpose web application
framework written in PHP.  It provides an extensive array of classes that are

    * Fixed XSS vulnerability in administrator scripts.
    * Improved XSS filter for HTML messages.
    * Several synchronization improvements.
    * Improved Oracle and MSSQL compatibility.
    * Fixed access keys on Mac browsers.
