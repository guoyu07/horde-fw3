The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Internet
Messaging Program (IMP) version H3 (4.3.4).

This is a bugfix and minor security release that fixes an issue with PGP
messages sent or received from a user on the local server. All users are
encouraged to upgrade to this release. Thanks to Peter Meier for reporting
this issue.

IMP, the Internet Messaging Program, is one of the most popular webmail
applications available.  It allows universal, web-based access to IMAP and
POP3 mail servers and provides a full range of features normally found only in
desktop email clients.

The major changes compared to IMP version H3 (4.3.3) are:
    * Don't cache local PGP public keys retrieved from the address book.
    * Fixed some URL escaping issue for certain links introduced with the
      security fixes from 4.3.3.
    * Fixed updating POP3 indices when deleting in mailbox view.
    * Fixed some folder creation issues occasionally seen, most often during
      maintenance tasks.
    * Other minor bugfixes.
