The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Internet
Messaging Program (IMP) version H3 (4.3.5).

IMP, the Internet Messaging Program, is one of the most popular webmail
applications available.  It allows universal, web-based access to IMAP and
POP3 mail servers and provides a full range of features normally found only in
desktop email clients.


The major changes compared to IMP version H3 (4.3.4) are:
    * Fix some javascript if using IE 8.
    * Fix unqualified domain preference.
    * Highlight signed messages depending on the signature verification.
    * Use correct charset when rendering inline PGP data.
    * Fix renaming shared folders contained in empty namespaces.
    * Correctly set charset of Bcc header in sent mail copy.
    * Correctly handle NO untagged responses on login.
    * Fix spellcheck in text-mode for certain words in non-English locales.
    * Allow to lock default_encrypt preference.
    * Fix display_folder hook.
    * Other minor bugfixes and improvements.
