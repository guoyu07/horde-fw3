The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Internet
Messaging Program (IMP) version H3 (4.3.3).

This is a minor security release that fixes unescaped output in several
scripts. All users are encouraged to upgrade to this release. Thanks to Gunnar
Wrobel for finding these issues in a code audit.

IMP, the Internet Messaging Program, is one of the most popular webmail
applications available.  It allows universal, web-based access to IMAP and
POP3 mail servers and provides a full range of features normally found only in
desktop email clients.

The major changes compared to IMP version H3 (4.3.2) are:
    * SECURITY: Escape output in message.php, pgp.php and smime.php
    * Several bugfixes and minor improvements
