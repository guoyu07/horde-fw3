The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Hermes Time
Tracking Application version H3 (1.0).

Hermes is a time tracking and reporting application written for the Horde
Framework. Taking advantage of the Framework for authentication and
presentation, it integrates seamlessly with other Horde applications allowing
users to track time against to do items (from Nag), tickets (from Whups), or
pre-configured projects within Hermes itself. The list of billable clients is
taken from the address book (Turba). Additionally, there is an OS X Widget to
allow Mac users to enter time directly from his or her Dashboard.
