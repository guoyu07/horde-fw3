This document contains instructions for installing the Ansel Photo Manager.

For information on the capabilities and features of Ansel, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the Ansel distribution.


Obtaining Ansel
===============

Ansel can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/ansel/

   ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/ansel/

Or use the mirror closest to you:

   http://www.horde.org/mirrors.php

Bleeding-edge development versions of Ansel are available via CVS; see the
file `horde/docs/HACKING`_ in the Horde distribution, or the website
http://www.horde.org/source/, for information on accessing the Horde CVS
repository.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Ansel **requires** the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Ansel runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common
   tools for Web applications written in PHP. You must install Horde before
   installing Ansel.

   .. Important:: Ansel 1.0 requires version 3.2.2 or greater of the
                  Horde Framework - earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/horde/

   The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server,
   at

      http://www.horde.org/horde/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

   Many of Ansel's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Ansel.

2. The following PHP capabilities:

   a. _`GD` support ``--with-gd``

      The GD extension provides functionality for image manipulation in
      PHP. You can alternatively use the imagick_ extension or the
      ImageMagick_ software, but one of these is **required**.

3. A database:

   Ansel needs a database to store information about images and galleries. Any
   database supported by MDB2 should work; MySQL and PostgreSQL are the most
   tested. If you use MySQL, you need at least version 5.0.

4. The following PEAR packages:
   (See `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ for instructions on installing PEAR packages)

   a. MDB2

      Ansel uses the MDB2 classes for database access.  In addition, you will
      need to ensure you have the proper MDB2_Driver package for your specific
      database backend.

5. The following PECL modules:
   (See `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ for instructions on installing PECL modules)

   a. _`imagick`

      The imagick module provides a quicker, more efficient interface to
      ImageMagick's capabilities and is used if Horde finds it available on
      your system.  It provides better results when doing things like
      generating thumbnails with rounded corners and drop shadows. To use the
      imagick module, make sure you still set the path to ``convert`` as
      described below. You can alternatively use the GD_ extension or the
      ImageMagick_ software, but one of these is **required**.

   b. _`OpenCV`

      The opencv module provides the ability to detect human faces in images.
      If you would like to be able to have Ansel automatically detect faces in
      your images, you will need to install the opencv module. You will still be
      able to manually select faces from your images if you do not have opencv
      installed.

      .. _ `OpenCV library`: http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/
      .. _ `PHP module`: http://d.hatena.ne.jp/moriyoshi/20070924/1190595577


      Alternatively, you may use the php-facedetect module instead of the
      php-opencv module. You will still need to install the OpenCV library.

      .. _ `PHP Module`: http://www.xarg.org/project/php-facedetect/

   c. _`libpuzzle`

      The libpuzzle module provides the ability to determine similarities
      between images based on the image content. If you would like Ansel to be
      able to provide recognition of similar images and similar faces, you will
      need to install this module.

      .. _ `libpuzzle library`: http://libpuzzle.pureftpd.org/project/libpuzzle

6. The _`ImageMagick` software.

   If using the `ImageMagick software`_ you need to set the path to the
   ``convert`` utility in Horde's setup screen
   (``Administration/Setup/Horde/Image Manipulation``). You can alternatively
   use the GD_ extension or the imagick_ extension, but one of these is
   **required**.

   .. _`ImageMagick software`: http://www.imagemagick.org/

Installing Ansel
================

Ansel is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible
directory. The precise location of this directory will differ from system to
system. Conventionally, Ansel is installed directly underneath Horde in the
web server's document tree.

Since Ansel is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary; simply
expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename the root
directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear in the URL. For
example, with the Apache web server's default document root of
``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``, you would type::

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/ansel-h3-x.y.z.tar.gz
   mv ansel-h3-x.y.z ansel

and would then find Ansel at the URL::

   http://your-server/horde/ansel/


Configuring Ansel
=================

1. Configuring Horde for Ansel

   a. Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.php``, find the ``applications['ansel']``
      stanza. The default settings here should be okay, but you can change
      them if desired. If you have changed the location of Ansel relative
      to Horde, either in the URL, in the filesystem or both, you must update
      the ``fileroot`` and ``webroot`` settings to their correct values.

2. Creating the database tables

   The specific steps to create Ansel's database tables depend on which
   database you've chosen to use.

   First, look in ``scripts/sql/`` to see if a script already exists for your
   database type. If so, you should be able to simply execute that script as
   superuser in your database. (Note that executing the script as the "horde"
   user will probably fail when granting privileges.)

   If such a script does not exist, you'll need to build your own, using the
   file ``ansel.sql`` as a starting point.  If you need assistance in creating
   database tables, you may wish to let us know on the Ansel mailing list.

   You will also need to make sure that the "horde" user in your database has
   table-creation privileges, so that the tables that `PEAR MDB2`_ uses to
   provide portable sequences can be created.

   .. _`PEAR MDB2`: http://pear.php.net/MDB2

3. Configuring Ansel

   To configure Ansel, change to the ``config/`` directory of the installed
   distribution, and make copies of all of the configuration ``dist`` files
   without the ``dist`` suffix::

      cd config/
      for foo in *.dist; do cp $foo `basename $foo .dist`; done

   Or on Windows::

      copy *.dist *.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of those files can be found in each
   file. You may edit these files if you wish to customize Ansel's appearance
   and behavior.

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Ansel. Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get
   to the administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration`` icon to
   get the configuration page. Select ``Photos`` from the selection list of
   applications. Fill in or change any configuration values as needed. When
   done click on ``Generate Photos Configuration`` to generate the
   ``conf.php`` file. If your web server doesn't have write permissions to the
   Ansel configuration directory or file, it will not be able to write the
   file. In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and choose one of the
   other methods to create the configuration file ``ansel/config/conf.php``.

   Note for international users: Ansel uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found
   in the ``po/`` directory. If a translation is not yet available for your
   locale (and you wish to create one), see the ``horde/po/README`` file, or
   if you're having trouble using a provided translation, please see the
   `horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for instructions.

   Note for users of Lighttpd web server: The pretty url generation relies on
   rewrite rules being configured on your web server. Since lighttpd does not
   support htaccess files like Apache, there is also a configuration file for
   lighttpd included that contains the necessary rewrite rules. This file is::

       docs/lighttpd-ansel.conf

   Instructions for using it are included in the file.


4. Testing Ansel

   Once you have configured Ansel, bring up the included test page in your Web
   browser to ensure that all necessary prerequisites have been met. See the
   `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ document for further details on Horde test
   scripts. If you installed Ansel as described above, the URL to the test
   page would be::

      http://your-server/horde/ansel/test.php

   The test script will also allow you to test...

   Next, use Ansel to create galleries and photos. Test at least the
   following:

   - Generate galleries
   - Upload photos
   - Edit photo properties
   - Edit photos
   - Delete photos
   - Delete galleries
