The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the Ansel
Photo Management and Web Gallery application version H3 (1.0-RC1).

Ansel is a full featured photo management application. With it, you can organize
your photos in any number of galleries and subgalleries, share galleries among
other Horde users or even make them public. Ansel supports a wide range of
features. See http://www.horde.org/ansel/ for more information.

This is a preview version. It is considered feature complete but there might
still be a few bugs.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated and new translations are very welcome, though some
strings might still change before the final release.
