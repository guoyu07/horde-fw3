These are instructions to upgrade from earlier Ansel versions. Please
backup your existing data before running any of the steps described below.


Upgrading Ansel from 1.0 to 1.1.x
=================================

Some fixes to the share tables have been made for users of PostgreSQL. In
addition to the instructions below, you also need to run the
``scripts/upgrades/1.0_to_1.1.pgsql.sql`` script.

Geotagging
----------

Ansel 1.1 introduces geotagging support and integration with Google Maps. There
are some changes to the database schema to better support this. Previous
versions of Ansel may have captured location information from images that
contained such data in the EXIF fields. Any such data that was retrieved will
be migrated to the new schema as well. You MUST run the following script EVEN IF
YOU DO NOT PLAN ON USING GEOTAGGING FEATURES::

    php scripts/upgrades/1.0_to_1.1.php

In addition to the above, if you wish to use the geotagging feature, you will
need an API key from Google for the Maps API.
