The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Whups Ticket
Tracking System version H3 (1.0.1).

Whups is a Horde ticket-tracking application. It is very flexible in design,
and can be used for help-desk requests, tracking sofware development, and
anything else that needs to track a set of requests and their status.

The major changes compared to Whups version H3 (1.0) are:
    * Added flag to disable old versions
    * Apply simple markup highlighting on comments
    * Showing version changes in the ticket history
    * Added Turkish translation
    * Several small bug fixes and improvements
