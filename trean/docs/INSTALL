 Installing Trean 0.1
======================

:Last update:   $Date: 2007/06/19 09:56:35 $

This document contains instructions for installing the Trean web-based
bookmarks application on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of Trean, see the
file README_ in the top-level directory of the Trean distribution.


Obtaining Trean
===============

Trean can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/trean/

   ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/trean/

Or use the mirror closest to you:

   http://www.horde.org/mirrors.php

Bleeding-edge development versions of Trean are available via CVS; see the
file `horde/docs/HACKING`_, or the website http://www.horde.org/source/, for
information on accessing the Horde CVS repository.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Trean **requires** the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Trean runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common tools
   for web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   installing Trean.

   .. Important:: Trean requires version 3.2+ of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server,
   at

      http://www.horde.org/horde/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

   Many of Trean's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Trean.

Configuring Trean
=================

1. Configuring Horde for Trean

   a. Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.php``, find the applications['trean'] stanza.
      The 'status' parameter must be marked '=> active'.  If you have changed
      the location of Trean relative to Horde, either in the URL, in the
      filesystem or both, you must update the ``fileroot`` and ``webroot``
      settings to their correct values.

   b. Configuring a DataTree backend

      Trean requires a permanent ``DataTree`` backend in Horde to manage
      bookmarks.  If you didn't setup a DataTree backend yet, go to the
      configuration interface, select Horde from the list of applications and
      select a driver different than ``None`` on the ``DataTree System`` tab.
      Make sure that you ran the necessary scripts to create a storage backend
      for the DataTree system, e.g. one of the ``create.*.sql`` or
      ``horde_datatree.*.sql`` SQL scripts in ``horde/scripts/sql/``.  You
      should have done this already during the installation of Horde.

2. Configuring Trean

   To configure Trean, you must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator.  Use
   the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get to the administration page,
   and then click on the ``Configuration`` icon to get the configuration page.
   Select ``Bookmarks`` from the selection list of applications, and click on
   the ``Configure`` button.  Fill in or change any configuration values as
   needed.  When done click on ``Generate Bookmarks Configuration`` to
   generate the ``conf.php`` file.  If your web server doesn't have write
   permissions to the Trean configuration directory or file, it will not be
   able to write the file.  In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and
   choose one of the other methods to create the configuration file
   ``trean/config/conf.php``.

   Note for international users: Trean uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found
   in the ``po/`` directory.  If a translation is not yet available for your
   locale (and you wish to create one), or if you're having trouble using a
   provided translation, please see the `horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for
   instructions.

3. Testing

    It needs lots so just start playing.
