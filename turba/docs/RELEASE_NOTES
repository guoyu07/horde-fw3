The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Turba Contact
Manager version H3 (2.3.3).

Turba is the Horde contact management application. It is a production level
address book, and makes heavy use of the Horde framework to provide
integration with IMP and other Horde applications. It supports SQL, LDAP,
Kolab, and IMSP address books.

    * Added preference for the name format to use for sorting.
    * Support X-ANNIVERSARY, X-CHILDREN, and X-SPOUSE vCard fields.
    * Correctly track deletions during synchronization.
    * Improved Oracle and MSSQL compatibility.
    * Added Croatian translation.
