The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Ingo Email
Filter Rules Manager version H3 (1.2.3).

Ingo is an email-filter management application. It is fully internationalized,
integrated with Horde and the IMP Webmail client, and supports both
server-side (Sieve, procmail) and client-side (IMAP) rule creation.

Major changes compared to the Ingo H3 (1.2.2) version are:
    * Improved/fixed vacation rules in maildrop and procmail drivers.
    * Improved Oracle and PostgreSQL compatibility.
    * Added Croatian translation.
    * Other bug fixes and improvements.
