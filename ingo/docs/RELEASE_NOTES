The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Ingo Email
Filter Rules Manager version H3 (1.2.1).

Ingo is an email-filter management application. It is fully internationalized,
integrated with Horde and the IMP Webmail client, and supports both

Major changes compared to the Ingo H3 (1.2) version are:
    * Added ability to hide the script icon.
    * Added Basque translation.
    * Several bug fixes.
